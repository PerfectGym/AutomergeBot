Cannot merge automatically. @{{gitHubUserName}} please resolve conflicts manually, approve review and merge pull request.
Be aware that when someone's PR has not been merged before yours PR and then has been merged,
yours PR still has info about conflicts.
Github does not update it and lies that conflicts are present. 

How to do it (using the GIT command line):
1. Fetch changes from server and checkout '{{destinationBranch}}' branch.
   Then merge 'origin/{{pullRequestBranchName}}' branch and resolve conflicts
   ```
   git fetch -q && git checkout -q {{destinationBranch}} && git reset -q --hard @{u} && git merge --no-ff origin/{{pullRequestBranchName}}
   ```
2. Approve [pull request]({{pullRequestUrl}}/files#submit-review) review
3. Push changes to {{destinationBranch}}
   ```
   git push origin {{destinationBranch}}
   ```
